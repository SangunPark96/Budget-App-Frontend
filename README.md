# Budget Application - SangUn Park - Cohort 9.3 - Pursuit

### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]
(https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is my project for Cohort 9.3 Days for Pursuit. This is the React
front-end of a basic budget logging application. Simply access the link above 
from your computer. To start, the website comes preloaded with 3 items in the 
list, you can delete them or edit them as you see fit. Depending on wether or 
not the item is a deposit or withdrawal, a corresponding emoji will be displayed.

To access this application locally, clone and you will need to npm install to 
have access to all needed dependencies like react, react-router-dom, axios, Uuidv1. 
Create a .env file and place the code REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3003
within the file and you should be good to go.
