# Budget Application - SangUn Park - Cohort 9.3 - Pursuit

### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]
(https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is my project for Cohort 9.3 Days for Pursuit. This is the React
front-end of a basic budget logging application. Simply access https:/
/tubular-nougat-512add.netlify.app/ from your computer. To start, the
website comes preloaded with 3 items in the list, you can delete them
or edit them as you see fit. Depending on wether or not the item is a
deposit or withdrawal, a corresponding emoji will be displayed.
